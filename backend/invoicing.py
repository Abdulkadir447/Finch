"""Invoicing — one saved invoice per order, numbered per business.

The PRD lists "Invoice generation" as a v1 capability. Until now the only
invoice in the product was a printable modal rendered from order data: it had
no number, no record, and nothing a customer could be sent twice.

What this module adds is the *document record*:

* a per-business sequential number (``INV-0001``, ``INV-0002``, ...) that is
  stable once issued — the unique index ``(business_id, number)`` makes a
  collision impossible rather than unlikely;
* one invoice per order — ``(business_id, order_id)`` is unique, so "create
  invoice" can never double-issue paperwork to a customer;
* a document lifecycle (``draft`` -> ``sent`` -> ``void``) with issue/due
  dates and free-text notes.

What it deliberately does NOT do: store money. An invoice points at its order
and the order stays the single source of truth for amounts, so there is no
total column that can drift. Recording money *received* belongs to the
payments phase (a gateway decision) and is not here.
