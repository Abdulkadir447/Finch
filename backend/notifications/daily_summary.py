"""Daily Business Summary (PRD v1 daily notification).

Architecture — reuse, don't re-implement:

    Business data
        ↓
    Existing reporting/briefing calculations
        ↓
    Verified DailySummary object (this module)
        ↓
    In-app notification presentation (frontend)

No second calculation path exists:
  * revenue / orders / comparisons  -> reports.service._scoped_lines
  * notable insights                -> briefing.build_briefing (verified)
  * low / out-of-stock              -> the shared stock definitions
  * new customers today             -> one direct, trivial query

The LLM is NOT involved in producing this summary. It is computed on demand
and is stateless: requesting it multiple times the same day yields the same
underlying summary (no records are created, so nothing can duplicate). No
scheduler or background worker is needed for v1.
