"""Co-op sync — cloud -> local PULL (OFFLINE 3, Part 1).

Builds the mirror payload the desktop app downloads to populate (and later
refresh) its local SQLite mirror. This is the server half of the initial
pull + reconnect refresh; the renderer downloads it (with the Clerk token)
and hands it to the main-process mirror module, which upserts it into SQLite
by stable identity (client_id, falling back to server id for cloud-native
rows).

Full vs. delta:
  * No ``since``  -> full dump (initial pull). Includes soft-deleted rows so
                     the mirror can reflect deletions.
  * ``since`` set -> delta: rows with ``updated_at >= (since - 1s)`` (and,
                     for the immutable stock_movements ledger,
                     ``created_at >= (since - 1s)``). Comparing against a
                     floor one second BEFORE the cursor makes deltas
                     at-least-once: a row updated in the same second as the
                     cursor is re-delivered (harmless — the client upserts
                     idempotently by client_id) instead of being lost. The
                     1-second step is what makes the same-second guarantee
                     hold on SQLite, where CURRENT_TIMESTAMP stores
                     'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' but SQLAlchemy binds datetime
                     parameters as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.ffffff' — in that
                     text comparison a plain ``>= cursor`` sorts same-second
                     rows BELOW the bound value and would drop them from
                     every future delta.

The payload is read-only and carries no secrets. Each record carries both
``id`` (server id) and ``client_id`` (ULID, or null for cloud-native rows) so
the local/cloud identity mapping stays stable (OFFLINE 3 requirement). The
returned ``cursor`` is second-precision and monotone non-decreasing
(max(now, incoming since)) so the ``>=`` delta is at-least-once and never
regresses.
