"""
Database connection and session management for FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (async).

Targets Supabase/Postgres via asyncpg. All API endpoints depend on the
`get_db()` generator which yields an AsyncSession that is automatically closed
after the request. The URL is resolved lazily on first engine use so importing
this module never touches the environment or loads a DB driver (Task 11 /
audit H3).
