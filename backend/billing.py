"""Real Billing + Credits (phase: make credits and plan enforcement real).

The dependency chain, top to bottom:

    AI request  ->  ai_usage ledger  ->  credits consumed
                 ->  plan allowance (config)  ->  remaining balance
                 ->  enforcement  ->  Billing UI  ->  (payment provider later)

Design decisions
----------------
* **Credits are computed, never stored.** ``remaining = allowance - SUM
  (ai_usage.credits_used this month)``. The ledger written by the AI
  service is the single source of truth — there is no balance column that
  can drift, and re-computation is always reproducible.
* **Calendar-month periods.** Allowances refresh on the 1st; usage is
  month-to-date. Simple, deterministic, testable.
* **Config-driven allowances.** Plan names/prices are product decisions
  (config/<env>.json "billing" section), so the credit economy can change
  without touching this code — same rule that governs the credit policy.
* **Payments are NOT in this phase.** Plan changes are real server-side
  state (enforcement and remaining are real), but nothing is charged until
  a payment provider is connected. The UI keeps its honest preview banner.
