"""Revenue forecasting (AI Platform phase — "Forecasting" deliverable).

Co-op's trust model applies to forecasts too: this is a TRANSPARENT trend
calculation over the business's real, verified order data — never a
black-box machine-learning prediction, and the UI always labels it as an
estimate (types.ts: "forecast — an estimate, never presented as an ML
prediction").

Method (deterministic, no third-party dependencies):
  * Series: monthly revenue from non-cancelled orders, over the last 12
    calendar months (current month included, marked in-progress). The
    series is TRUNCATED at the business's first order month — a business
    cannot have history before its first sale, and padding with zeros
    would corrupt the trend for young businesses.
  * Fit: ordinary least squares over the COMPLETED months only.
  * Estimate: the trend line evaluated at the next calendar month,
    clamped at zero (revenue cannot be negative).
  * Range: estimate ± max(residual std, 15% of estimate) — a plain,
    defensible spread, deliberately NOT labelled a confidence interval.
  * Fewer than 3 completed months of history -> ``available: false`` with
    an honest reason (the UI shows "not enough history yet").

Read-only; the same data on the same day always yields the same numbers.
