"""Append-only audit trail (BSD Ch1.17) — persistence + tenant-scoped reads.

Hardening backlog item: the ``audit_log`` table existed but nothing wrote to
it and it had no tenant column, so there was no way to show an owner their
own activity. This module provides the write helper (used by every mutating
endpoint and by the sync push path) and the list query. The HTTP route lives
in ``main.py`` (the codebase convention: routes in main.py, logic in domain
modules).
