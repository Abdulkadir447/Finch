## Brand & Style
The design system is engineered for a premium SaaS environment, prioritizing clarity, efficiency, and a sense of sophisticated reliability. The aesthetic follows a **Corporate / Modern** style with a refined, high-end finish. 

The visual language balances strict utility with "soft power"—using a predominantly white and light gray canvas to allow the vibrant primary purple to act as a beacon for action. The interface should feel airy and expansive, utilizing generous whitespace to reduce cognitive load. A signature AI identity is integrated through subtle, high-fidelity gradients that signify intelligence and premium features without disrupting the professional atmosphere.

## Colors
The palette is anchored by a vibrant, digital-first primary purple. This color is used for primary actions and brand presence. The secondary accent is reserved for highlights and deeper visual hierarchy.

- **Surface Tiers**: Use the background color for the application canvas and the card surface for all functional containers. This distinction creates a clear "inner vs outer" mental model.
- **Borders**: All structural elements use a subtle border to maintain definition against the light background.
- **AI Identity**: Elements powered by AI should utilize the linear gradient sparingly—typically as a subtle border-top, an icon treatment, or a background for small badges.

## Typography
This design system utilizes **Inter** exclusively to maintain a systematic and utilitarian feel. 

- **Page Titles**: Use a tight letter-spacing to give a modern, "locked-in" appearance.
- **Hierarchical Contrast**: Use the `label-caps` style for metadata and table headers to create strong visual differentiation from body text.
- **Scale**: Transitions between sizes should feel deliberate. Avoid using more than three distinct type levels on a single view to maintain the premium, uncluttered look.

## Layout & Spacing
The spacing rhythm is strictly built on an **8px grid**. This creates a predictable and harmonious layout that scales across all viewports.

- **Grid System**: Use a 12-column fluid grid for desktop and tablet, and a 4-column grid for mobile.
- **Vertical Rhythm**: Use `lg` (24px) or `xl` (32px) for spacing between major sections. Use `sm` (8px) for internal element grouping.
- **Alignment**: Elements should strictly align to the grid. In SaaS dashboards, prefer a "Fixed-Fluid-Fixed" layout where navigation and sidebars are fixed, and the main workspace scales to fit.

## Elevation & Depth
Depth in this design system is primarily achieved through **Tonal Layers** and **Low-Contrast Outlines**. 

- **Shadow Character**: Shadows are used only to communicate "lift" on interactive elements like modals, dropdowns, and active card states. Use a very diffused, low-opacity indigo tint (e.g., `rgba(91, 95, 239, 0.08)`) instead of pure black for shadows to keep the UI clean.
- **Elevated States**: 
  - **Level 0 (Flat)**: Background surface.
  - **Level 1 (Default)**: Cards with a 1px border. No shadow.
  - **Level 2 (Active/Hover)**: 1px border with a subtle 4px blur shadow.
  - **Level 3 (Overlays)**: Modals and menus with a 12px blur shadow and a 1px border.

## Shapes
The shape language is "Restrained Modern." A consistent **12px (0.75rem)** radius is applied to all primary containers (cards, modals, inputs).

- **Standard Elements**: 12px for cards, large buttons, and input fields.
- **Small Elements**: 8px (0.5rem) for smaller interactive components like chips or segmented controls.
- **Strict Square**: Never use 0px corners; every element must feel approachable and modern.

## Components

- **Buttons**:
  - **Primary**: Solid primary color with white text. 12px radius.
  - **Secondary**: Ghost style with 1px border and primary color text.
  - **AI Trigger**: Gradient background with a subtle "sparkle" icon.
- **Input Fields**: 1px border using the border color. On focus, the border shifts to the primary color with a 2px semi-transparent primary glow (halo).
- **Cards**: Background white, 1px border, 12px radius. Padding should follow the `lg` (24px) spacing rule.
- **Chips/Badges**: Small (8px) radius. Use a light tinted background (10% opacity of the semantic color) with high-contrast text for status indicators.
- **Lists**: Clean rows with a 1px bottom border. Hover states should use the background surface color to gently highlight the row.
- **AI Modules**: Any component containing AI insights should feature a 2px top-border using the AI Gradient to distinguish it from standard data.
